# Tomato discrimination üçÖ

Vegetables are waiting in a queue to be added to the soup.
Suddenly, the Botanical Government passes a new law: tomatoes are now officially fruits!

Thankfully, everybody still loves tomatoes in soups, so they won‚Äôt be removed.
But there‚Äôs a catch: all tomatoes must now be moved to the end of the queue, no matter where they were before the law. The order of all other vegetables must remain unchanged.

Be careful: some of them will try to mislead you by calling themselves pomodoro.
Don‚Äôt fall for it ‚Äî anyone who calls themselves "tomato" or "pomodoro" must go to the end.
Also, to avoid further confusion, rename all "pomodoro" to "tomato" before adding them to the end.

### Input ü•¶
A slice of strings ‚Äî each string represents a vegetable.
Only lowercase letters are allowed.
Only "tomato" and "pomodoro" should be discriminated.

### Output ü•ï
A slice of strings ‚Äî each string represents a vegetable.
The order of all non-tomatoes stays the same.
All "tomato" and "pomodoro" (renamed to "tomato") appear at the end of the queue.

### Examples ü•í:

- **Example 1**

    Input: `["cucumber", "tomato", "pepper", "tomato", "lettuce"]`

    Output: `["cucumber", "pepper", "lettuce", "tomato", "tomato"]`

- **Example 2**

    Input: `["tomato", "pomodoro", "lettuce"]`

    Output: `["lettuce", "tomato", "tomato"]`

- **Example 3**

    Input: `["cucumber", "pepper", "lettuce"]`

    Output: `["cucumber", "pepper", "lettuce"]`

- **Example 4**

    Input: `[]`

    Output: `[]`

### Solution üí°

You can find the solution code [here](./tomato_discrimination.go).

1. First, we define a helper function that checks whether a vegetable is `"tomato"` or `"pomodoro"`.

2. The main function modifies the input slice in-place.
    We use a `writeInd` pointer to track the position where the next non-tomato vegetable should be written.
    We iterate through the slice:
    
    If the current element is a tomato (or pomodoro), we skip it.

    If it's a non-tomato vegetable, we copy it to `vegetables[writeInd]` and increment `writeInd`.

    After this loop, all non-tomato vegetables are in their correct positions, in the original order.

3. Next, we fill the remaining part of the slice (starting from `writeInd`) with `"tomato"` ‚Äî because all `"pomodoro"` should be renamed to `"tomato"`.

[Here](./tomato_discrimination_test.go) you can find tests.
