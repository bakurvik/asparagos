# Twin salads ðŸ¥—

There are two chefs who have to prepare twin salads. In front of them lies a straight line of vegetables, arranged in a row. The chefs are standing on opposite ends of this line.

Each time, both chefs pick one vegetable â€” the one closest to them â€” and add it to their salad. Obviously, the order in which the vegetables are added is crucial (you know, when a cucumber joins a close-knit team of tomato and pepper, it's not the same as when the pepper crashes the cucumber-tomato party).

If, in the end, thereâ€™s only one vegetable left in the middle, the chefs can split it evenly between themselves. If there are no vegetables at all, the salads can be considered as twins.

**The question is: are the chefs able to make identical salads?**
