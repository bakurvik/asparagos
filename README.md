# Asparagos 🥬👓💻

Hi! I'm **Asparagos** — an asparagus who codes in Go.
Here you’ll find everyday problems that a typical veggie might struggle with — and my Go solutions to them.

You can find all blog posts [here](https://dev.to/asparagos).

## 🧩 Problems I've already solved:

- 🥗 [Twin Salads](./twin_salads/README.md) | 📖 [Blog post](https://dev.to/asparagos/go-coding-with-asparagos-can-two-chefs-make-twin-salads-4de8)

  Two chefs. One line of veggies. Can they make identical salads?

- 🍅 [Tomato Discrimination](./tomato_discrimination/README.md) | 📖 [Blog post](https://dev.to/asparagos/go-coding-with-asparagos-tomato-discrimination-in-the-soup-queue-4i7)

  Tomatoes are now fruits. Can the soup survive?
